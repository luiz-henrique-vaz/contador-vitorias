# won-matches-count

This little web application, makes  part of basic JavaScript couse offering by Scrimba that i'm practicing. 

I turned this in a model to you count how many matches you won per day in Free Fire game.

When the button "increment" is activated, the value of victories will be increased. And the "save" button, is to save below how many matches you won at the end of the day

I hope you like my improve :D
